# Farm To Fork

This is the project I starting working on in CIS 4500 (Special Topics - iOS Development) with another student and then continued to work on indivdually in CIS 4900 (Computer Sceience Project). The app is not 100% complete in terms of functionality since the scope of the project was to create a Proof Of Concept.

Please note, that the server that the app uses is not mine (it belongs to the student I worked with in CIS 4500) so the app may stop working at any time. If it does, please let me know!
