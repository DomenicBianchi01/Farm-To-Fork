# Farm To Fork

This is the project I starting working on in CIS 4500 (Special Topics - iOS Development) with another student and then completed indivdually in CIS 4900 (Computer Sceience Project).

Please note, that the server that the app uses is not mine (it belongs to the student I worked with in CIS 4500) so the app may stop working at any time. If it does, please let me know!

Check out the Wiki page (on the GitHub repo) for instructions on how to use the app.
